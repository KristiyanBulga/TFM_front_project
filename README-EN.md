Master's degree final project about the development of a tool to evaluate a retailer’s online presence against its competitors. The aim of this project is to create a process of data extraction and homogenisation that can be applied to any type of business. The development of this project has focused on restaurants.


## *TFM_front_project* repository

In this repository, a web application has been developed using Angular. The goal of this web application is to be the ool to evaluate a retailer’s online presence against its competitors. To do this, we have used the API generated in the backend project that we can find in the repository [*TFM_project*](https://github.com/KristiyanBulga/TFM_project)

The application has been compiled with `ng build --prod` to convert it into a static web application, that can be uploaded to an S3 container that acts as a web host. If you want to test the application locally, you can do so with `ng serve -o`.

A demo of the web application is shown below.
